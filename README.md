Secure electronic voting using block chains.

Challenges faced today:

1. Transparency/ alleged tampering of EVMs: 
   The 2019 LS elections showed many allegations on mass tampering of EVMs. Many videos showing that got viral but nothing has been finally provem. Nonetheless, this seeded a point of uncertainty in the general mass.
   
   
2. Physical absence of voters in their constituencies during the elections:
   In the recent elections, the voter turnout was around 60%. ALthough this is an improved condition, one of the major reasons that contribute to poor turnout is the absence of the voters in their registered constituency during elections. 
 
 
3. The wait in long queues:

4. Chances of muscle men troubling you.


Steps:
Online voting.

Here, two cases are possible:
1. Privately voting through your homes/ workplaces.
2. Arrangement of kiosks at election booths.

The current statistics show that out of 1.3 billion Indian citizens, around 627 million will have access to the internet by 2019. So for these citizens, it is not advisable and covenient to opt for the first option. 
The rest elligible voters can opt for the first option. This not only reduces the time expended in long queues but also makes it easy for people who live away from their constituencies to vote.

Process:

Keeping the current scenario almost the same, where some of the voters register online, while rest of them register offline, where the users can register providing their valid photo IDs (UID/ passport/ driving license), an address proof (UID/ electricity bills etc) and a date of birth proof (birth certificate/ 10th marksheet etc).  A data base of all these voter IDs can be maintained electronically on a cloud. A unique serial number/ registration number can be issued to each voter. This can be sent to the voter via SMS or via paper slips when they are registering offline. It shall be assumed that the voters preserve carefully.

The current system demands the physical presence of the voter, where the eelction officer verifies the face of the person against the photograph in the voter id. This can be replaced by an electronic verification process which uses digital image rocessing/ face recognition tool. The idea is that the voter, whether seated at his/ her house or ready to caste a vote, can be photographed using a camera, that is available in most of the smart phones/ laptops today or which can be installed in the proposed kiosks. This live snap then can be compared to the already existing photograph of the voter present in the database.

A block-chain based appication is made using Microsoft Azure. The application would be linked to the voter IDs' electronic database. Firstly, the voter logs in using the primary details like name, age, father's/husband's name etc. Next, the application enables face recognition and a live snap of the voter is taken. All these details are compared to that stored in the linked database. Next the user enters the token, which is essentially the serial number/ registration number. Once all of these is verified using the voters' database, an attendance can be marked on the list itself. Next, the application provides the list of the candidates with their symbols and brief information. The voters cast their votes by simply tapping. This vote is stored in a blockchain.
